//## Declaring Variables

//### JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

//#### 1. var (Old way – avoid using in modern code)


var name = "Alice";


//#### 2. let (Preferred for variables that change)


let age = 25;
age = 26; // Can be updated


//#### 3. const (Preferred for constants – can't be changed)


const birthYear = 2000;
// birthYear = 2001; ❌ Error – can't reassign a const
